# NoTransfer
> A sort of WeTransfer, but don't always get the proper file back

## Story :innocent:
This lovely project was built for the April Timathon of 2022. We did our best to fit into the theme: *Make things a bit less ordinary*. This wasn't the first idea we had in mind, but since we had some tehnichal difficulties with the first one, we went with the latter one. I think it was a good choice since we are really happy about how this project turned out. We hope you will like it as well...

## Team :sunglasses: :handshake: :sunglasses:
- Tudor Dicu

## Try it :point_left:
The website is live at https://notransfer-c7ebf.web.app. If you want to run the website on your local machine, it is very easy to set up:
1. Create a local web server.
```
python run.py
```
2. Open a web browser and go to the address the webserver is showing. For example: 127.0.0.1:8000
3. Enjoy

### Note :information_source:
This project is connected to a separate database, hosted by firebase. Even if you run this project on your home computer, you will still have access to everything everybody has posted.

## Source code :computer:
We tried to keep the code as organised and as clean as we could. If you are interested in the code, feel free to take a look. :rofl:

## Warnings :thinking: :warning:
- :exclamation: run.py is a python 3 script. **If you are on mac os or a linux distribution**, you might have to run:
```
python3 run.py
```

- :exclamation: The files you upload to this website **must not contain personal or sensitive information, or any kind of inappropriate content**, since everybody can download your file and see it.
